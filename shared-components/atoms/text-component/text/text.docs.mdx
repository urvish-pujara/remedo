> This component works as an Editable Typography field and currently works as part of a form built with _react-hook-form_ and does not expose state directly.
> For a simple typography component, prefer the MUI `Typography` component.

Although style can be passed through the `style` prop, prefer to have the style passed down from the theme given to the `ThemeProvider` component.

The component supports 4 states:
- Normal
- Edit
- Loading
- Error

On click inside the `Text` container, the state changes from `Normal` to `Edit`.
On clicking outside the container, it changes back to `Normal`.
The state can also be passed as a Prop.
When `Loading` state is passed, it renders a skeleton.

The component also supports validation directly from _react-hook-form_. Validation logic is passed directly to the wrapper component `FormWrapper`.

The component does not support HTML input for now. That functionality might be added later.
